# immigrant-demographics
This project was designed to highlight my data wrangling and visualization skills by creating a few interactive graphics to explore recent demographic developments in the U.S. and Germany using Plotly.

# Motivation 
As part of my Masters program in Political Economy of European Integration, I wrote a research paper assessing the different forms of immigration available in both the United States and Germany and how these entry categories affect immigrantsâ€™ access to social welfare programs. You can read that paper here: https://theresagasinski.wordpress.com/2019/03/15/the-life-of-a-civilized-being/. To complement that research, I designed a few interactive graphics to explore recent demographic developments in the U.S. and Germany using Plotly. 

# Data Source
Data was taken from the US Office of Immigration Statistics, US Census Bureau, the Migration Policy Institute, and the Statistiches Bundesamt. 

# How to use 
To run both the Cleaning and Wrangling.ipynb and Graphs.ipynb files, download the /input folder files and first run the Cleaning and Wrangling.ipynb file. To only view the graphs, first download the /clean folder files.
